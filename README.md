# Concurrent infinite series
Concurrent solutions for the calculation of the Euler's number through an infinite series using threads.

# Build and run
In the src directory,<br>
`$ javac fileName.java`<br>
`$ java fileName -nterms n`<br>
where `n` is the number of terms to be calculated for the summation.
